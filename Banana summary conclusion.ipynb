    "The models and pipelines presented in this analysis are exploratory and designed to evaluate the potential of aroma compound data for ripeness classification. While current sample sizes are limited and may lead to overfitting, the goal is to establish a robust framework that can be scaled as more data becomes available. These pipelines enable early identification of promising features and latent patterns, which can inform future experimental design and data collection. As sample sizes grow, the same workflows can be retrained and validated to yield generalizable, interpretable models suitable for scientific and operational use."
